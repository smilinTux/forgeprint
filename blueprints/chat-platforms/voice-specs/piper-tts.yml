strengths:
  - "Fully local, no cloud dependency"
  - "GPL-3.0 license (compatible)"
  - "Fast inference on CPU"
  - "Wide language support"
  - "Small model sizes (15-75MB)"

weaknesses:
  - "Quality below cloud TTS (Eleven Labs, etc.)"
  - "Limited voice cloning"
  - "English models strongest, others vary"
