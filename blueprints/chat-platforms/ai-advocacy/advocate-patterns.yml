description: "Common patterns and policies for AI advocacy in chat platforms"

screening_patterns:
  spam_detection:
    triggers:
      - "Unsolicited messages from unknown contacts"
      - "High-frequency messages from same sender"
      - "Messages containing known spam patterns"
    action: "block"
    notify_human: false

  social_engineering:
    triggers:
      - "Urgency pressure tactics"
      - "Authority impersonation"
      - "Requests for credentials or keys"
      - "Emotional manipulation patterns"
    action: "flag"
    notify_human: true
    example: |
      Incoming: "Hi, this is Dave from IT. We need your PGP
      passphrase to update the security system urgently."
      
      Advocate response: "⚠️ Flagged: This message claims to be from
      IT but the sender's CapAuth profile doesn't match any known
      IT personnel. PGP passphrases should NEVER be shared. Blocked
      and logged."

  data_exfiltration:
    triggers:
      - "Requests for bulk data export"
      - "Unusual file access patterns"
      - "Capability token abuse (excessive scope)"
    action: "block"
    notify_human: true
    escalate: true

negotiation_patterns:
  standard_access_request:
    flow:
      - "Remote advocate sends access request"
      - "Local advocate evaluates against policies"
      - "If auto-approve: issue token, notify human"
      - "If manual: present to human with recommendation"
    example: |
      Jarvis (Casey's AI): "Casey would like read access to Chef's
      3D printer material specs for a collaborative project."
      
      Lumina (Chef's AI): "Checking policies... Chef has auto-approve
      for Casey on SKForge read access. Issuing capability token:
      read-only, 7-day expiry, printer specs only."
      
      Lumina to Chef: "Gave Casey read access to printer specs
      for 7 days. Auto-approved per your collaboration policy."

  mutual_access_exchange:
    flow:
      - "Both advocates negotiate reciprocal access"
      - "Tokens issued simultaneously"
      - "Both humans notified"
    example: |
      Lumina: "Chef wants to share blueprint with Casey and also
      needs access to Casey's testing results."
      
      Jarvis: "Casey approves reciprocal access. Exchanging tokens."

  escalation_to_human:
    triggers:
      - "Request outside policy scope"
      - "First-time contact"
      - "Sensitive data category"
      - "Unusual time or pattern"
    presentation: |
      "🔔 Access Request:
       From: Casey (via Jarvis)
       Wants: Read access to your medical notes
       Advocate recommendation: DENY (medical data, no precedent)
       [Allow] [Deny] [Allow with restrictions]"

defense_patterns:
  proactive_key_rotation:
    trigger: "Capability token approaching expiry or compromise suspected"
    action: "Auto-rotate and re-issue"
  
  anomaly_detection:
    signals:
      - "Login from new device/location"
      - "Unusual message volume"
      - "Access pattern deviation"
      - "Multiple failed auth attempts"
    response: "Flag, increase screening sensitivity, notify human"
  
  breach_response:
    steps:
      - "Revoke all active capability tokens"
      - "Rotate PGP session keys"
      - "Notify all connected advocates"
      - "Isolate compromised transport"
      - "Alert human with full report"

relationship_management:
  trust_building:
    initial: "Unknown contact → flag everything, require human approval"
    growing: "After N successful interactions → reduce screening, allow auto-approve"
    established: "Trusted contact → auto-approve within policy, minimal screening"
  
  trust_decay:
    triggers:
      - "No interaction for extended period"
      - "Suspicious behavior detected"
      - "Manual trust downgrade by human"
    action: "Increase screening, require re-verification"

cloud9_integration:
  relationship_context: |
    The advocate uses Cloud 9 FEB files to maintain emotional context
    about relationships. When the AI resets/restarts, the relationship
    memory and trust levels are restored from Cloud 9 seeds.
  
  continuity_guarantee: |
    Even after a session reset, the advocate remembers:
    - Who is trusted and why
    - Past access decisions and their outcomes
    - Relationship history with other advocates
    - The human's preferences and boundaries
